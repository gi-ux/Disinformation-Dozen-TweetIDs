# Disinformation-Dozen-TweetIDs

We made a collection of all possible activities of two lists of users previously established: disinformation dozen and good information. We obtained more than 700 thousand tweets divided according to the two categories and related to the activities (tweets, retweets, replies, quotes) from their date of subscription to Twitter until the date of data collection, August 2021. The retweets received by the two lists of users were then collected, obtaining more than 4 million total retweets in the period from September 2020 to August 2021.

We provide public access to this data in accordance with Twitter's terms of service, releasing tweet ids that can be used to retrieve full objects via the API. These can be "hydrated" using [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator).
