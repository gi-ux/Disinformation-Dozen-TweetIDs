# Disinformation-Dozen-TweetIDs

This repository contains a collection of tweets generated by a set of twelve individuals, referred to as **Disinformation Dozen**, who were responsible for 65% of Covid-19 misinformation circulating on social media according to a report released by the [center for countering digital hate](https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen).
To gather this set of tweets, we used the Twitter’s streaming API to collect both 1) the sharing activities performed by the Disinformation Dozen and 2) the retweets they received by other accounts. 

To contrast the online activity of the Disinformation Dozen, we also collected tweets of (and retweets received by) another set of accounts, named **Good Information** users, who contributed in the spreading of quality and accurate information to help raising awareness for combating Covid-19 diffusion. These accounts were listed in a [report](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/oppenheim/Covid-19_tweeps.shtml) as users to rely in the Covid-19 conversation on social media due to their proliferation of accurate information and their involvement in the health sector.

Overall, we gathered more than 700k tweets generated by **Disinformation Dozen** and **Good Information** users and more than 7M retweets received by these two classes of accounts.
In this repository, we provide public access to this data in accordance with Twitter's terms of service, releasing tweet IDs that can be used to retrieve full objects via the Twitter API.

## Data Organization
The structure of Tweet-IDs is as follows:
- Tweet-IDs are stored in folders indicating their origin (either Disinformation Dozen or Good Information).
- In every folder, there are two text files, one containing the tweet-IDs of the performed sharing activities and the other the tweet-IDs of the received retweets.
- Activity-related tweets were collected from users' date of subscription to Twitter until August 2021, while retweets were collected in the period ranging from September 2020 to August 2021, due to limitations imposed by the Twitter API.
- Tweets can be "hydrated" using [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator). To do so, just access the Hydrator github repository linked [here](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) and follow the installation instructions in the README.
